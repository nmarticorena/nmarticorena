## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a [PhD Researcher](https://research.qut.edu.au/qcr/people/nicolas-guillermo-marticorena-vidal/) at the [QUT Centre for Robotics(QCR)](https://research.qut.edu.au/qcr/). I previously worked as a Development Engineer at MindLabs, creating robotic solutions for agricultural applications. 
I hold a professional degree in electrical engineering from [Universidad de Chile](https://www.electricalengineering.cl/) and was part of the Uchile robocup@home teams as part of the [uchile-robotics](https://uchile-robotics.github.io/) lab.
- ðŸ”­ My current research focuses on mobile manipulation control.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on the integration of novel 3D scenes representation in a reactive mobile manipulator controller.
